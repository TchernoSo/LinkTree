                    <div class="des">Born in the Netherlands, moved to Portugal at the age of two.<br> My mother remembers how I always carried the ball with me, refusing to leave it behind, as it was the only thing I brought from home. <br>I would spend hours kicking the ball against the wall and playing alone in the streets until I started to be surrounded by amazing friends, and a few years later I joined my first amateur football club. <br>A few years later, I suffered an ACL injury, leading to surgery and six to eight months of recovery. This resulted in a decrease of my confidence and fitness, so I decided to take a break. (Never knew I'd come back!)

                    <div class="des">Art was starting to develop in my soul and I needed a challenge, something to push me further, so I decided to learn HipHop dance. Months later, I quit my job, sold my car, and left Lisbon, leaving behind my family and friends to move to London, a city renowned for its art scene, creativity, and diversity. I am thankful for the journey and the amazing people I have met.<br> I was able to join a skilled team that has helped me grow as a dancer, and together we have created unforgettable performances in London for four years.</div>

                    <div class="des">The pandemic!<br>Personally, the most lonely moment in my life. I found myself in deep reflections!<br>Have you ever felt that something good came out of something bad? That's exactly what happened to me. This period helped me grow as a person and understand what truly matters in life.<br>
                        I affirm that difficult times can lead us to a deeper understanding of who we are and what we are capable of. Since then, I have been writing and dedicated to creating a world where no one has to face challenges alone.</div>
