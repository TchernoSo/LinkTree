                        Life itself has been my greatest teacher and taught me the importance of embracing the journey with open arms. <br> Sports showed me the values of discipline and teamwork, Art increased my creativity and imagination and Tech taught me the ability to innovate and optimize.
                        Today I am who I am because of the choices I made, my choices created my path.

                    <div class="des">Born in the Netherlands, moved to Portugal at the age of two.<br> My mother remembers how I always carried the ball with me, refusing to leave it behind, as it was the only thing I brought from home. <br>I would spend hours kicking the ball against the wall and playing alone in the streets until I started to be surrounded by amazing friends, and a few years later I joined my first amateur football club. <br>Just 4 years later, I suffered an ACL injury, leading to surgery and six to eight months of recovery. This resulted in a decrease of my confidence and fitness, so I decided to take a break. (Never knew I'd come back!)

                    <div class="des">Art was starting to develop in my soul and I needed a challenge, something to push me further, so I decided to learn HipHop dance and months later, I quit my job, sold my car, and left Lisbon, leaving behind my family and friends to move to London, a city renowned for its art scene, creativity, and diversity. I am thankful for the journey and the amazing people I have met.<br> I joined a skilled team who helped me grow as a dancer and together we created unforgettable performances in London for four years.</div>

                        Difficult times can lead us to a deeper understanding of who we are and what we are capable of. Since then, I have been writing and dedicated to creating a world where no one has to face challenges alone "The Soul".</div>

                        After research and questions, I decided to begin the journey of studying computer science and programming. From my first line of code to building this website from scratch. Day by day, I found myself increasingly fascinated with the magic of code, the power of algorithms, and the capability to generate something out of nothing. Coding for me is like a limitless game, with constant upgrades but never an end. I will continue on this journey and see what the future holds.</div>
