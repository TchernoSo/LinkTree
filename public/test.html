                    <div class="des">At only two years old, I moved from Netherlands to Portugal with a passion for football. I went from playing alone in the streets to being surrounded by amazing friends and signing my first amateur football club at 14. After just 4 years, my dream of becoming a professional football player were shattered when I suffered a (ACL) knee ligament injury that required surgery and six to eight months of recovery. The process exhausted me greatly, resulting in a decrease in both my confidence and fitness. As a result, I chose to take an break. (Never knew I'd come back!)

I am grateful for the journey so far and the incredible people I met along the way, they helped me develop my individual abilities and knowledge. From dancing alone and traveling to a new city to join a highly experienced team that helped me evolve as a dancer and together, we created unforgettable performances across London for four years.</div>

                        Difficult times can lead us to a deeper understanding of who we really are and what we are capable of. After learning about the concept of life and its challenges, I successfully transformed myself into a better person. Since then, I have helped others in similar situations.</div>
