      <h1>Heart + Mind = Soul</h1>
      <h5 class="text">
        Welcome Soul, Tcherno here, an entirely artist self-taught.<br />
        <br />
        At age 2, I moved from the Netherlands to Portugal with a passion for football. A ball and a goal were all I needed
        to
        be happy. But in 2014, my dreams of becoming a professional football player were shattered when I suffered a
        devastating
        knee ligament injury (ACL) that required surgery. <br />
    
        <br /> In 2016, I left Lisbon for London, eager to pursue my passion for dance and challenge myself to learn and
        grow in
        a different environment. Luckily I had the chance to join a highly experienced crew, where I met incredible people
        who
        supported my evolution as a dancer.
        Together, we created unforgettable performances across the vibrant city for four years.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2020, the pandemic changed our lives, including mine,
        during that period in order to guide myself through a difficult moment on my own,
        I started exploring the world of life coaching,
        which didn't come as a surprise considering my family and friends had previously observed that on me,
        but I always chose to focus in my other passions, like football, but tough times, lead us to a deeper
        understanding of who we really are and what we are
        capable of.<br />
        After learning about the concept of life and its challenges, I successfully disciplined myself and transformed into
        a
        better person. Since then, I have been helping others in similar situations<br /><br />
        In 2022, I challenged myself to develop a new skill: learning computer science and programming. This pursuit has opened
        up exciting new possibilities, such as building this website entirely from scratch, and brought me to where I am today. <br /><br />
    
        This is my journey of self-taught, discipline and consistency, for over 15 years. <br />
        The fusion of my passions and unimaginable journey, from sports to dance to life
        coaching to programming, has shaped me into a better version of myself for sure and
        I'm excited to see where this multifaceted path takes me in the future.
        <br /> <br />
        Thank you
        <br /> <br />
        Tcherno So
