        Hi, I'm Tcherno, an artist and football enthusiast, and I am entirely
        self-taught.<br />
        <br />
        A dance instructor, life coach and programmer since 2022.<br />My incredible journey, blessed me with
        countless people across Europe, where each one taught me something special.<br /><br /> Been dancing since 2016 alongside a highly experienced
        crew, where I had the chance to boost my growth and evolution, as we
        worked together creating unforgettable performances acroos the vibrant
        city of London, UK for over 4 years.<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, in 2020, the pandemic changed our lives, including mine, during that period, which didn't come as a surprise considering my family and friends had previously observed it in me, but I always choose instead to focus on pursuing my true passions,
        it's during tough times we gain something
        special, leading to a deeper understanding of who we really are and what we are
        capable of, because we are pushed to our limits and forced to confront our weaknesses and deepest desires.<br /> So I started this journey
        when I needed to overcome a challenging period of my life, clear my
        mind, eliminate the fear and self-doubt, set new goals, and be
        consistent, focusing only on what's truly important to me, and I have successfully obtained my certification from the Universal Coach Institute.<br />
        <br />
        Since 2022, I've been delving into the fascinating world of computer
        science and programming, embarking on a new learning adventure. This
        pursuit has opened up exciting new possibilities and has brought me to
        where I am today. The fusion of my diverse passions, from dance to life
        coaching to programming, has shaped me into a better version of myself and
        I'm excited to see where this multifaceted path takes me in the future.
        <br />
