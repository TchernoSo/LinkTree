    <h1>From my Soul</h1>
    <h5 class="text">
      Dear Soul. <br />Tcherno here, an entirely artist self-taught, let me share a bit of my journey.<br />
      <br />
      At only two years old, I moved from Netherlands to Portugal with a passion for football. I went from playing alone in the streets to being surrounded by amazing friends and signing my first amateur football club at 14. After just 4 years, my dream of
      becoming a
      professional football player were shattered when I suffered a (ACL) knee ligament injury that required surgery and
      six
      to eight months of recovery. The process exhausted me greatly, resulting in a decrease in both my confidence and fitness. As a result, I chose to take an indefinite break. (Never knew I'd come back!)<br />

      <br />
      In 2016, I left Lisbon and moved to London to pursue my passion for dance and challenge myself to learn and grow in a new
      environment. I am grateful for the journey so far and the incredible people I met along the way, who are now very close friends. They helped
      me develop my individual abilities and knowledge.
      From dancing alone and traveling to a new city to join a highly experienced team that helped me evolve as a
      dancer. Together, we created unforgettable performances across the vibrant city for four years.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 2020, the pandemic changed everybody lives, including mine. During that difficult time, I started exploring
      the
      world of life coaching to guide me through.
      <br />
      Difficult times can lead us to a deeper understanding of who we really are and what we are capable of. After
      learning
      about the concept of life and its challenges, I successfully transformed myself into a better person.
      Since
      then, I have dedicated myself in helping others in similar situations.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 2022, I challenged myself to learn computer science and programming, something I had always found interesting
      but
      difficult to tackle long-term. This journey opened up new and exciting possibilities, like building this website
      entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. I am grateful for the knowledge and skills I have gained so far, and I am excited to see what the
      future
      holds. <br />
      <br />
      This is my journey of self-education, discipline, and consistency. For more than 15 years, I have been passionate
      about
      learning and growing. I have explored a variety of skills, in sports, art, life, and tech.
      </br>
      This journey has shaped me into a better person, and I am excited to see where it takes me next.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank you
      <br />
      <br />
      Tcherno So
