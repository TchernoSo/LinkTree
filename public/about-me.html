        Hi, my name is Tcherno, an artist, dance instructor, life coach and programmer and I am entirely
        self-taught.<br />
       
        <br />On my journey, I had the opportunity to meet people across the world, where each one taught me something unique.<br /><br />
      
I was born in the Netherlands, spent my entire life in Portugal, and am currently residing in the United Kingdom.<br />
         Starting from dance, been dancing since 2016 
        alongside a highly experienced
        crew, where I had the chance to boost my growth and evolution as we
        worked together, creating unforgettable performances acroos the vibrant
        city of London for 4 years. "Artist"<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, in 2020, the pandemic changed our lives, including mine, 
        during that period in order to guide myself through one of the most difficult phases I've experienced, 
        I started exploring the world of life coaching,
         which didn't come as a surprise considering my family and friends had previously observed that on me, 
         but I always chose to focus on pursuing my other passions, like football, I always dreamed to become a professional football player, where I invested 8 years,
        but tough times, lead us to a deeper understanding of who we really are and what we are
        capable of, because we are pushed to our limits and forced to confront our weaknesses and deepest desires.<br /> 
        So I started learning life coaching in order to lead myself, clear my
        mind, eliminate the fear and self-doubt, set new goals, and be
        consistent, focusing only on what I can control, and 1 year later... I successfully disciplined myself, into a better person and since then I have been helping others in similar cases."Life Coach"<br />
        <br />
        Summer of 2022, I've been delving into the fascinating world of computer
        science and programming, embarking on a new learning adventure. This
        pursuit has opened up exciting new possibilities and has brought me to
        where I am today, like this website, I built entirely from scratch. "Programmer" <br />
        It's 7 years all together of self-taught, discipline and consistency. <br />
        The fusion of my passions and unimaginable journey, from dance to life
        coaching to programming, has shaped me into a better version of myself and
        I'm excited to see where this multifaceted path takes me in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
