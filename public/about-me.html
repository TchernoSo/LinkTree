        Hi, my name is Tcherno, an artist and football enthusiast, and I am entirely
        self-taught.<br />
        <br />
        A dance instructor, life coach and programmer since 2022.<br />My incredible journey, blessed me with
        countless people across Europe, where each one taught me something special.<br /><br /> Been dancing since 2016 alongside a highly experienced
        crew, where I had the chance to boost my growth and evolution, as we
        worked together creating unforgettable performances acroos the vibrant
        city of London, UK for 4 years.<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, in 2020, the pandemic changed our lives, including mine, during that period in order to guide myself through one of the most difficult phases I've experienced, I started exploring the world of life coaching, which didn't come as a surprise considering my family and friends had previously observed it in me, but I always chose instead to focus on pursuing my other passions,
        it's during tough times we gain something
        special, leading to a deeper understanding of who we really are and what we are
        capable of, because we are pushed to our limits and forced to confront our weaknesses and deepest desires.<br /> So I started this journey
       in order to clear my
        mind, eliminate the fear and self-doubt, set new goals, and be
        consistent, focusing only on what I can control, and 2 years later... I have successfully obtained my certification from the Universal Coach Institute, through an intensive four-month bootcamp.<br />
        <br />
         After summer of 2022, I've been delving into the fascinating world of computer
        science and programming, embarking on a new learning adventure. This
        pursuit has opened up exciting new possibilities and has brought me to
        where I am today, like this website, I built it entirely from scratch. <br />The fusion of my diverse passions and unimaginable journey, from dance to life
        coaching to programming, has shaped me into a better version of myself and
        I'm excited to see where this multifaceted path takes me in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
