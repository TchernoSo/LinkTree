        Hi, I'm Tcherno, an artist and football enthusiast, and I am entirely
        self-taught.<br />
        <br />
        I'm a dance instructor, life coach and programmer since 2022.<br />Along
        my incredible journey, I've been blessed enough to cross paths with
        countless people across europe, each one taught me something unique and
        special. I've been dancing since 2016 alongside a highly experienced
        crew, where I had the chance to boost my growth and evolution, as we
        worked together to create unforgettable performances acroos the vibrant
        city of London, UK for 4 years.<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, the pandemic changed our lives, including mine. I
        discovered a newfound passion for life coaching, which might come as a
        surprise, believe it or not, it's during tough times we gain something
        special, leading to a deeper understanding of who we are and what we are
        capable of, because we are pushed to our limits and forced to confront
        our strengths, weaknesses, and deepest desires. I started this journey
        when I needed to overcome a challenging period in my life, clear my
        mind, eliminate the fear and self-doubt, set new goals, and be
        consistent, focusing only on what's truly important to me... and a few
        months later I did, I made it and I'll keep going.<br />
        <br />
        Recently, I've been delving into the fascinating world of computer
        science and programming, embarking on a new learning adventure. This
        pursuit has opened up exciting new possibilities and has brought me to
        where I am today. The fusion of my diverse passions, from dance to life
        coaching to programming, has shaped me into the person I am today, and
        I'm excited to see where this multifaceted path takes me in the future.
